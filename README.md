This is the repository for the project "No Time to Waste" developed at Chalmers (Gothenburg) as part of the iGEM competition 2020. Here, you can find the code we used to perform all our dry-lab analysis. Welcome!

## Project Overview
*No Time To Waste* aims to enzymatically degrade the plastic fibers that are present in clothes, such as elastane, to release the natural materials that can be reused to produce new clothes.
By doing this, we would provide a mean to recycle denim and other garments. Hence, we would not only prevent the accumulation of textiles in landfills, where they present a problem and immobilization of resources, but also contribute to reduce the production of cotton, a process which requires tremendous amounts of energy.
To do this, we used the power of synthetic biology to give our bacterial strain the capabilities of other bacteria that have been shown to be able to degrade plastic.
